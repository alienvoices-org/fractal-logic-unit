## 1. Mathematical Debt

### OD-16 — Delta-Min Conjecture for Z_19

**Status:** 🔴 OPEN

**Statement:** No APN bijection (δ=2) exists over Z_19. Formally: δ_min(Z_19) = 3
for all bijections f: Z_19 → Z_19.

**Evidence:**
- OD-16-PM (PROVEN): all bijective power maps have δ ≥ 4 (Hasse-Weil).
- V14 search: extended polynomial families (binomials, trinomials, Dickson) — best δ=4.
- Random search: 8,000,000 trials, best δ=3 (~3.2% rate). No δ=2 found.
- GOLDEN_SEEDS[19] contains 8 best-available δ=3 seeds (documented as non-APN).

**What the V15.3 audit established:** The δ=3 seeds for n=19 form a separate weaker
result (DN2-δ3 proposition) with B_max = 2.463√19. The core DN2 theorem explicitly
excludes n=19. The question of whether any APN bijection exists remains fully open.

**Closure path:** GPU batch DDT (50M+ trials); algebraic obstruction via representation
theory of S_19; character sum analysis of all bijection families over Z_19.

---

### OD-17 — Delta-Min Conjecture for Z_31

**Status:** 🔴 OPEN

**Statement:** δ_min(Z_31) = 3 for all bijections over Z_31.

**Evidence:**
- OD-17-PM (PROVEN): all bijective power maps have δ ≥ 4.
- Random search: 3,300,000 trials, best δ=3 (~3.1% rate).
- GOLDEN_SEEDS[31] contains 8 best-available δ=3 seeds.

**Closure path:** Same as OD-16.

---

### OD-34 — Hamiltonian Continuity of the Kinship Curve

**Status:** 🔴 OPEN

**Statement:** Applying hyperoctahedral group actions Ω_j at carry levels j (the
`RotationHub`) preserves the Hamiltonian property (T2).

**Closure path:** Prove Ω_j acts as a symmetry of the local n^j sub-block, ensuring
the exit coordinate of block B_k matches the entry of B_{k+1}.

---

### DN1 — Lo Shu Fractal Digital Net Conjecture

**Status:** 🔵 CONJECTURE (registered, not a V16 blocker)

**Statement:** The recursive Lo Shu fractal embedding f_k: Z_3^{2k} → [0,1)^{2k} forms
a (t,2k,2k)-net in base 3 with t ≤ t_0 for some constant t_0 independent of k.

**Note:** OD-27 (PROVEN) handles the general FractalNetKinetic case. DN1 is the
specific Lo Shu fractal variant, where digit propagation across Lo Shu blocks is the
key open difficulty.

**Closure path:** Niederreiter digital net theory; Faure/Pascal angle on the T matrix.

---

## 3. Arithmetic & Calculus

### OPER-3 — Sparse Forward Differences (The Derivative)

**Status:** 🟡 PARTIAL

**Requirement:** Define `M.delta(axis)` as an O(D) operator returning field of
differences: Δ_j M[x] = M[x + e_j] − M[x].

**Closure path:** Implement as a specialized `SparseArithmeticManifold` node querying
two related coordinates in the operator tree.

---

## 4. Long-Horizon Research

### OD-35 — Distributive Law

**Statement (candidate):** (M₁ ⊕ M₂) ⊗ M₃ = (M₁ ⊗ M₃) ⊕ (M₂ ⊗ M₃).
Close path: `InvarianceFacet` entropy measurement on both sides.

### OD-36 — APN Asymptotics

**Statement (candidate):** Characterise the sparsity of APN bijections as n → ∞.
The empirical rate ~3.2% for n=19, n=31 (δ=3 best) suggests a density argument.
Connection to algebraic geometry over finite fields (Weil bounds, character sums).

### NEW-1 — Generator Matrix Parameterisation Theorem

**Statement (candidate):** Every linear digital sequence over Z_n^D can be expressed
as σ(M·a(k)) for M ∈ GL(d, Z_n) and bijection σ: Z_n → Z_n. Discrepancy class, Latin
property, and spectral behaviour fully determined by (M, σ).
Subsumes T9 (M=T), FMD-NET (M=I), DN2 (σ=APN), Faure (M=P^m).
**Status:** 🔵 RESEARCH.

### NEW-3 — Min-entropy Hamiltonian Latin Uniqueness (OD-19 corollary)

**Status:** 🔵 RESEARCH. T4 PROVEN; uniqueness waits on OD-19 (OPEN).

### NEW-4 — Modular Pascal Fractal Dimension

**Statement (candidate):** Hausdorff dimension of the FM-Dance "Sierpiński Strata"
equals the dimension of the Pascal triangle mod n.
**Status:** 🔵 RESEARCH. BPT provides the carry distribution; fractal geometry
connection to Pascal mod n is the gap.

## 5. Documentation Debt

### DOC-1 — PAPER.md: Section 3 theorem tables incomplete

**Status:** 🟡 PARTIAL

Section 3 theorem tables (3.1–3.7) were not updated to include V15.2/V15.3 additions.
Missing from the tables: DN2 (now PROVEN), DN2-ETK, DN2-WALSH, DN2-VAR, DN2-ANOVA,
UNIF-1, DISC-1, FMD-NET, OD-32-ITER, SRM, C4, T7, LEX-1, INT-1, GEN-1, INV-1.
Section 4.7 (ScarStore) still refers to HM-1 as "conjecture" in prose.
**Fix:** Extend Section 3 with sub-section 3.8 covering V14/V15/V15.3 additions;
update §4.6 (FractalNet) with Owen scrambling results and DN2 proof summary.
