## 1. Documentation Debt

### DOC-1 — README's / PAPER.md / THEOREMS.md : Theorem tables may be incomplete compared to source registry

**Status:** 🟡 PARTIAL

The debt DOC-1 can never be completed. It is eternal task to prevent documentation drift and improve it. 
Specific Issues can be added here:

## 2. Theorem Registry Integration Debt

### DNO-OQ1 — FractalNetOrthogonal `depth=k` parameter (k>1 in Python)

**Status:** 🟡 PARTIAL (theory PROVEN, engineering pending)

**Statement:** DNO-REC-MATRIX proves A^(k) ∈ GL(4k,Z_n) → OA(n^(4k),4k,n,4k) for all k.
Implementation: expose a `depth=k` parameter in `FractalNetOrthogonal` that builds the
base_block at level k (recursively applying the DN1-GL formulas k times).

**Current state (V15.3.2):**
- d=4 (k=1): fully implemented (`FractalNetOrthogonal`)
- d=8 (k=2): oracle mode via `SparseOrthogonalManifold(n, d=8)` ✓
- d=8 VHDL: `generate_vhdl_dno(n, k=2, mode='sequential'/'parallel')` ✓
- d=8 benchmark: `bench_dno_orthogonal.py` Section A/C confirms d=8 machine-epsilon ✓
- **Remaining gap:** `FractalNetOrthogonal(n=3, depth=2)` Python streaming generator.
  Theory PROVEN (DNO-REC-MATRIX). Engineering target V16.

### DNO-OQ2 — Scrambled Discrepancy Lower Bound

**Status:** 🔵 RESEARCH

**Statement:** DNO-ASYM proves D*_N(DN1-REC+DN2) = O((log N)^{4k}/N). Open question:
is this also a Θ lower bound, or can the scrambled rate be improved beyond O((log N)^{4k}/N)?

---

### DNO-OQ3 — Explicit Constant C_APN^{OA}(4)

**Status:** 🔵 RESEARCH

**Statement:** Compute the constant C_APN^{OA}(4) explicitly for n ∈ {5,7,11}. Do the DN1
OA base and DN2 scrambling improvements compound multiplicatively, or does the OA structure
modify the character sum mechanism?

## 3. Mathematical Debt

### OD-16 — Delta-Min Conjecture for Z_19

**Status:** 🔴 OPEN

**Statement:** No APN bijection (δ=2) exists over Z_19. Formally: δ_min(Z_19) = 3
for all bijections f: Z_19 → Z_19.

**Evidence:**
- OD-16-PM (PROVEN): all bijective power maps have δ ≥ 4 (Hasse-Weil).
- V14 search: extended polynomial families (binomials, trinomials, Dickson) — best δ=4.
- Random search: 8,000,000 trials, best δ=3 (~3.2% rate). No δ=2 found.
- GOLDEN_SEEDS[19] contains 8 best-available δ=3 seeds (documented as non-APN).

**What the V15.3 audit established:** The δ=3 seeds for n=19 form a separate weaker
result (DN2-δ3 proposition) with B_max = 2.463√19. The core DN2 theorem explicitly
excludes n=19. The question of whether any APN bijection exists remains fully open.

**Closure path:** GPU batch DDT (50M+ trials); algebraic obstruction via representation
theory of S_19; character sum analysis of all bijection families over Z_19.

---

### OD-17 — Delta-Min Conjecture for Z_31

**Status:** 🔴 OPEN

**Statement:** δ_min(Z_31) = 3 for all bijections over Z_31.

**Evidence:**
- OD-17-PM (PROVEN): all bijective power maps have δ ≥ 4.
- Random search: 3,300,000 trials, best δ=3 (~3.1% rate).
- GOLDEN_SEEDS[31] contains 8 best-available δ=3 seeds.

**Closure path:** Same as OD-16.

---

### OD-34 — Hamiltonian Continuity of the Kinship Curve

**Status:** 🔴 OPEN

**Statement:** Applying hyperoctahedral group actions Ω_j at carry levels j (the
`RotationHub`) preserves the Hamiltonian property (T2).

**Closure path:** Prove Ω_j acts as a symmetry of the local n^j sub-block, ensuring
the exit coordinate of block B_k matches the entry of B_{k+1}.

---

## 4. Arithmetic & Calculus

### OPER-3 — Sparse Forward Differences (The Derivative)

**Status:** 🟡 PARTIAL

**Requirement:** Define `M.delta(axis)` as an O(D) operator returning field of
differences: Δ_j M[x] = M[x + e_j] − M[x].

**Closure path:** Implement as a specialized `SparseArithmeticManifold` node querying
two related coordinates in the operator tree.

---

## 5. Long-Horizon Research

### OD-35 — Distributive Law

**Statement (candidate):** (M₁ ⊕ M₂) ⊗ M₃ = (M₁ ⊗ M₃) ⊕ (M₂ ⊗ M₃).
Close path: `InvarianceFacet` entropy measurement on both sides.

### OD-36 — APN Asymptotics

**Statement (candidate):** Characterise the sparsity of APN bijections as n → ∞.
The empirical rate ~3.2% for n=19, n=31 (δ=3 best) suggests a density argument.
Connection to algebraic geometry over finite fields (Weil bounds, character sums).

### NEW-1 — Generator Matrix Parameterisation Theorem (partially addressed by DNO-FULL)

**Statement (candidate):** Every linear digital sequence over Z_n^D can be expressed
as σ(M·a(k)) for M ∈ GL(d, Z_n) and bijection σ: Z_n → Z_n. Discrepancy class, Latin
property, and spectral behaviour fully determined by (M, σ).
Subsumes T9 (M=T), FMD-NET (M=I), DN2 (σ=APN), Faure (M=P^m).
**Status:** 🔵 RESEARCH.

### NEW-3 — Min-entropy Hamiltonian Latin Uniqueness (OD-19 corollary)

**Status:** ✅ CLOSED (within linear-digit scope). OD-19-LINEAR PROVEN V15.3+; Corollary 3 of PROOF_OD19_LINEAR.md closes NEW-3 for linear-digit bijections. Full generality (all Gray-1 Ham. paths) remains RESEARCH.

### NEW-4 — Modular Pascal Fractal Dimension

**Statement (candidate):** Hausdorff dimension of the FM-Dance "Sierpiński Strata"
equals the dimension of the Pascal triangle mod n.
**Status:** 🔵 RESEARCH. BPT provides the carry distribution; fractal geometry
connection to Pascal mod n is the gap.
