FM-Dance Theorem Suite — V14.

This module contains the complete formal theorem set for the FM-Dance
lattice traversal. Formalised V11; extended V12; audit-integrated V14.

MATHEMATICAL CLASSIFICATION
────────────────────────────
  "A triangular affine transform of radix-n digits producing a
   Hamiltonian Latin traversal of the toroidal lattice Z_n^D."

  Historical anchor: exact n-dimensional generalisation of the classical
  Siamese (de la Loubere) magic-square construction (circa 1693).

    Proof verification tiers
    ────────────────────────
    "sketch_and_computational"
        Algebraic proof sketch EXISTS and the claim is
        computationally verified by the test suite across
        n ∈ {3,5,7} and d ∈ {2,3,4}.  No formal proof
        assistant was used.  Not peer-reviewed.

    "algebraic_sketch"
        Algebraic proof sketch exists (correct to the best
        of the authors' knowledge) but no dedicated
        computational verification line in tests/.
        The overall test suite still runs 196/196.

    "empirical"
        CONJECTURE status. Observed across tested cases.
        No algebraic argument exists yet.

    "peer_reviewed"
        Published in a peer-reviewed venue. (None yet — V12+.)

    This field addresses the external audit observation:
        'these are internal proofs, not peer reviewed'.
    The accurate description is: algebraic sketch + computational
    verification for all PROVEN theorems in this package.

# ── OD-27: Digital Net Conjecture (Lo Shu Recursive Embedding) ──────────────
#
# V14 rigour audit established (OD-26) that FM-Dance traversal is NOT a
# low-discrepancy sequence: the triangular prefix-sum transform introduces
# inter-axis correlations that exceed random discrepancy for prefix lengths
# N = 50–400.
#
# However, the same audit identified a distinct construction — recursive
# Lo Shu fractal embedding — that *could* bound discrepancy at every scale.
# This is the Digital Net Conjecture (OD-27), registered here as a formal
# CONJECTURE awaiting proof.
#
# Mathematical Background
# -----------------------
# A (t, m, s)-net in base b is a set of b^m points in [0,1)^s such that
# every elementary interval of volume b^(t-m) contains exactly b^t points.
# t = 0 is perfect uniformity; t << m is the goal.
#
# The Lo Shu fractal construction:
#
#   Level 0: Lo Shu 3×3 grid  →  9 points, 2D
#   Level 1: embed each of the 9 cells into a 3×3 sub-block  →  81 points, 4D
#   Level k: n^(2k) points in 2k dimensions
#
# Formally, the level-k embedding f_k: Z_3^(2k) → [0,1)^(2k) is defined by:
#
#   f_k(a_0,...,a_{2k-1}) = Σ_{i=0}^{k-1}  lo_shu[a_{2i}, a_{2i+1}] / 3^{i+1}
#
# where lo_shu[r,c] ∈ {1,...,9} is the Lo Shu entry at position (r,c),
# re-indexed to {0,...,8} and mapped to the pair (row, col) in Z_3².
#
# The conjecture is that this recursive construction is a (t, 2k, 2k)-net
# in base 3 with t bounded by a constant (independent of k).

# ── DN2: APN-Scrambled Digital Net ─────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# V15.2+ SCOPE CLARIFICATION:
#   DN2 applies to the APN regime: n ∈ {5,7,11,13,17,23,29} where δ_min=2.
#   n=19 and n=31 have δ_min=3 (no APN bijection exists, OD-16/17 conjecture);
#   they form a separate weaker result documented in the proof paper.
#
# V15.2+ ARCHITECTURAL UPDATE (FLU-Owen scrambling):
#   Previous architecture (V15.1.3): one APN perm per depth, shared across all D dims.
#   New default (V15.2+): independent APN perm per (depth m, dimension i) pair.
#   Seed index formula: GOLDEN_SEEDS[n][(seed_rank + m*D + i) % len(seeds)].
#   This matches Owen (1995) structural independence.  FFT benchmark confirmed:
#   21% additional reduction vs. coordinated at N=3125, n=5, D=3.
#
# CHARACTER SUM AUDIT (V15.2+, corrected with factoradic_unrank directly):
#   All APN seeds (n ≤ 17): max|χ_f(h,Δ)|/√n ≤ 2.0 (DN2-C holds)
#   Power-map seeds (n ≡ 2 mod 3): ratio = 1.000 exactly (Weil tight)
#   n=7 APN seeds: ratio = 1.152 (uniform across all 8 seeds)
#   n=13 APN seeds (10 seeds after cleanup): max ratio = 1.913
#   n=19 δ=3 seeds: max ratio = 2.463 (not APN; separate weaker result)

# ── OD-33: FM-Dance as (0,D,D)-Digital Sequence (PROVEN V15) ─────────────────
#
# Closes OD-33 (RESEARCH). The FM-Dance kinetic traversal x(k) = T·digits(k)
# is a (0,D,D)-digital sequence in base n for all odd prime n.
#
# Proof strategy:
#   1. Generator matrix C = T (lower-triangular, det = -1 ≠ 0 in GF(n) for prime n).
#   2. Rank D over GF(n) ↔ t = 0 for every D×D block sub-matrix.
#   3. Each consecutive block of n^D points is a translation of the base block,
#      and translations of (0,D,D)-nets are again (0,D,D)-nets.
#   4. FMD-NET (PROVEN) supplies the base block directly.
#
# Scope: kinetic traversal only (fm_dance_path.py). Does NOT cover the
# FractalNet radical-inverse construction (OD-27/DN1 — separate objects).
